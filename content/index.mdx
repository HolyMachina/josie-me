# About Josie

## Portfolio

What do I share with the world?

### Work Experience

I've worked in the technology industry since 2012, and datacenters (the cloud) since 2014.

I have worked in roles as a generalized IT technician in non technology scope, a datacenter technician, a people manager, a program manager, and most recently a product manager. A majority of that time is with a single company.

My career's focus has always been about removing impediments for people that are doing work that benefits humanity.

### Creative Projects

I am also a creative type my creative projects are:

* [Last Contact](https://lastcontact.space), a hopepunk web novel set in the 2200s and 2300s.
* **BRAND NEW** [Tethics](https://tethics.blog), a blog about the intersection between technology and ethics.

## Other Stuff

### Background

I'm an elder millennial trans girl just trying to work my though every day as myself with all the authenticity I can muster. I have a partner and a dog.

I grew up in the Chicago Metro Area in the US and lived in the Pacific Northwest for a little bit before coming back. I'm still here, somewhere calling myself a Chicagoan without actually living in the city of Chicago's boundaries.

I try to work in my career in a way that is aligned with my values, and express my creativity though writing on fictional and non-fictional topics that are important to me.

### What about the other stuff?

I play video games. My favorites include too many to name but here are some: Final Fantasy Series, Legend of Zelda Series, Sim City, basically most RPGs or Simulations. I'm playing games like Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero right now. Yeah, all the cool characters sucked me in.

I watch anime, movies, and various TV Series. I'm into Star Trek *and* Star Wars. Anyone who says one is better than the other is... well... short sighted. They both have their purposes. Some of my favorite anime shows are Angel Beats!, Orange, Azumanga Daioh, Nichijou, Evangelion, Gundam 00, basically anything that can rip my heart out or give me fits of laughter.

### Touch Grass?

Oh, yeah, I am an Eagle Scout. Sometimes I still go touch grass through camping, hikes, long walks with my dog, or stuff like that.

### Important things I believe in

* Time is an illusion; lunchtime doubly so.
* Impatience for victory always leads to defeat.
* Always be your authentic self; it's the only person you can be successfully.
* Freedom of speech does not imply freedom from consequences of that speech.
* If you make a system that doesn't support the humans in it, the system doesn't deserve to be supported by the humans.
* Accessibility isn't a feature, it's a requirement.
